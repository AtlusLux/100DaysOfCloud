# The Day of Learning

- Today was really light. Helped with class today and watched students really put brains outside of the box with a CTF activity. Awesome to see this stuff happen. Most of the day was spent with family and some light studying for the upcomming exam (after the usual adulting chores!)

    - Not much excitement today, for the challenge but still learning applied!


## Cloud Research

- Today I went into more of Azure Core Services. Learning baseline functionallity and trying to bring usage/cost together to really build the understand of 'Why this > that' for the task. Some really neat stuff, also went and goofed around in the Cloud Shell just to get a feel for it. 

Easy day for the weekend! Will have to see what I can cook up tomorrow after much needed time with the family!
